<h1>Arduino vs ESP-IDF</h1>
<p>Arduino is known as a great platform for <em>getting started</em>
MCU programming. It's not known for being a
professional-grade, or even optimal and efficient development platform.
Yet, to our surprise, and to a lot of others online<sup id="fnref:spislow1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:spislow1">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:spislow2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:spislow2">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:spislow3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:spislow3">3</a></sup>,
Arduino completely outperforms the official ESP-IDF SDK in SPI speed.</p>
<p>This is not a problem under usual circumstances, but when we had to read out
a 64-channel ADC at 22 kHz over SPI, this suddenly became an issue. The Arduino
prototyping code would happily achieve the required speeds, yet
the ESP-IDF code would not keep up.
The scope showed this was not because of the SPI transmission itself,
but much much larger delays between transmissions, caused a lot more code executing
between transmissions.</p>
<p>In the end, this is because the ESP-IDF master driver has a <em>lot</em>
more configuration options than the Arduino api, and tries to expose the entire API
using a single function call and a <code>spi_transmission_t</code> struct.</p>
<p>This single call then has to set up the required hardware registers,
<em>each time</em> it is called, even when the hardware registers are
already configured in the right way (which is definitely the case when
sending the same request over-and-over again).</p>
<h1>ESP-IDF internals</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>User code</strong>: the code you're writing calls into the</li>
<li><strong>SPI Master Driver</strong>, which is a high level API over the</li>
<li><strong>Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)</strong> which calls into the</li>
<li><strong>Low-level (LL)</strong> header library to talk to the hardware registers</li>
</ul>
<p>The SPI Master Driver and HAL
are separately compiled to object files,
meaning it is impossible for the compiler to
do something like contant-folding through the user-calling code.
Instead, it has to do a lot of checks
which we <em>could</em> statically now not to happen.
Sadly, link-time-optimization is not officialy available<sup id="fnref:lto"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:lto">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The final LL resides in inlinable functions in a header definition.
Ideally, we could call directly into these functions in the hot path!</p>
<h1>Faster in the loop</h1>
<p>SPI setup is tedious, and we prefer not to write code for this manually.
The RX-TX loop is however much simpler, but very important to be performant.
So we came up with the following solution:</p>
<p>We use the SPI Master Driver to set up the neccesarily registers,
using an initial full transfer.
After that, we just re-execute the low-level calls needed to
perform a transmission:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Writing the TX register</em></li>
<li><em>Set the transmission flag</em> to signal the hardware we're ready to transmit</li>
<li><em>Keep polling the transmission flag</em> until the hardware signals the transmission is ready</li>
<li><em>Reading the TX register</em></li>
</ul>
